# Udacity Neighborhood Map Project

This project was created as part of Fullstack Nanodegree course from Udacity. I developed a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. I added additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. I also made some research and implemented third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

To bootstrap fast this project, I used Bootstrap 4 and [Light Bootstrap Dashboard](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/light-bootstrap-dashboard).
